An airplane is heavier than air. It will fall to the ground under the influence of gravity unless lift is applied. The plane’s wings are able to produce the necessary lift because of their shape. The upper surface is curved, while the lower surface is flat. To get past the curved surface, the air that flows over the wing has to go farther—and therefore faster—than the air that flows under it. This creates a difference in air pressure between the upper and lower surfaces as the plane moves forward. The air underneath is under greater pressure and therefore pushes the wing up. The faster the air flows past the wings, the greater the lift. For this reason, an airplane takes off most easily when it faces the wind.

Pilots use flaps and slats to change the amount of lift. Lowering the flaps increases the curved surface of the wing, which provides more lift for takeoff. Slats also increase lift by allowing air to flow more smoothly over the wing. Raising the flaps reduces lift, which slows down the plane for landing.
